Drawn to humanity's highest quests,I seek
influence, power, and the keys to ultimate
wellbeing not for vanity but to fulfill my
purpose. I crave the wisdom of the few. the
enlightenment our ancestors dreamed of.


My first project with a microcontroller, I used an infrared sensor to trigger a relay attached to a 120 volt, ac circuit used to energize nichrome wire, cut to proper length, stuffed inside of a tin foil rocket body packed full of both crushed match tip and strike strip powder. 

This was not a great way to combust the rocket, but what can I say, I was not following any guide here. I had dreamed this project up from scratch, and

It was successful. The sound of that tiny rocket flying across the room will never leave my mind.

I did this inside a government building during this schooling phase of my military career. The icing on the cake is while soldering some of the components out of the back of my car in the parking lot, looking not particularly white american, one of the other students family who had been visiting the base, reported me as possible bomb threat. Thankfully, the report was not base wide, and was only to the barracks managers of the building I was in front of. Also, thankfully, they didn't suspect me of combusting rockets in my room, just because I was soldering something in the parking lot.

The moral of this story is I go hard and I don't give a fuck what it looks like on the outside, to spectators. The truth of the matter is the shit I do is both phenomenal and has the potential quality of looking like a crack heads doing it.

As the saying goes, if you can program
A toy robot arm, you can program a car crushing robotic arm.

This is what teaching yourself looks like. This is what being passionate about something looks like. This is what pursuing knowledge at all cost looks like. This is what thinking outside of the box looks like.

If I were to redo this project today, i'd use a 360 degree camera, instead of an infrared sensor and make sure the face of my enemy was taking the projectile blast, which would not be a tin foil stuffed rocket. It would be projectiles embedded into my windowsills waiting for you to break my home barrier.

Get fucked
